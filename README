Increase Youtube Views Tips (Updated in 2016.10.19)

Although no one actually knows how Youtube’s view count system works, these are just some recommendation from some of other fandom used. 

[ MV List ] 
- Only Officaily MV: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLihL1B00sa9QYGjcuUZszOg0gZpxdwb4s
- Including all songs and SIA: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLihL1B00sa9StJlhk0xB_FwGDPrZP-Iku 

[ Tips ]
- Make your own playlist or use mine. The playlist should include more than 2 songs
- Let that playlist play on loop (Remember click the loop button)
- If you want to refresh the same mv, don't use the robot only refresh at exact same time. Please find robot that refresh in random
- Stream in 720p or above
- Watch the full video without pausing and above 50% volume
- If you want to mute the audio on chrome, you can use this => chrome://flags/#enable-tab-audio-muting; if you use safari, then safari has already had this feature on their tab
- Make sure you DO NOT simply click ‘replay’ or refresh the page or the views will be considered spam
- Play the video in Incognito or clear your watch history (https://www.youtube.com/feed/history) on Youtube periodically (some people said that you should clear after 200 views but no one know exactly how often)
- Clear cache and cookies as often as you can
- (Optional, seldom view this point) Play the list without login. All the view from same person will be counted into one
- (Optional, seldom view this point) Don't block the Ad
- (Optional, seldom view this point) If possible, change your IP periodically
