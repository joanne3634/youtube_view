# Increase Youtube Views Tips (Updated in 2016.10.19)

Although no one actually knows how Youtube’s view count system works, these are just some recommendation from some of other fandom used. 

MV List
--- 
1. Only Officaily MV: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLihL1B00sa9QYGjcuUZszOg0gZpxdwb4s
2. Including all songs and SIA: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLihL1B00sa9StJlhk0xB_FwGDPrZP-Iku 

Tips
--- 
1. Make your own playlist or use mine. The playlist should include more than 2 songs
2. Let that playlist play on loop (Remember click the loop button)
3. If you want to refresh the same mv, don't use the robot only refresh at exact same time. Please find robot that refresh in random
4. Stream in 720p or above
5. Watch the full video without pausing and above 50% volume
6. If you want to mute the audio on chrome, you can use this => chrome://flags/#enable-tab-audio-muting; if you use safari, then safari has already had this feature on their tab
7. Make sure you DO NOT simply click ‘replay’ or refresh the page or the views will be considered spam
8. Play the video in Incognito or clear your watch history (https://www.youtube.com/feed/history) on Youtube periodically (some people said that you should clear after 200 views but no one know exactly how often)
9. Clear cache and cookies as often as you can
10. (Optional, seldom view this point) Play the list without login. All the view from same person will be counted into one
11. (Optional, seldom view this point) Don't block the Ad
12. (Optional, seldom view this point) If possible, change your IP periodically
